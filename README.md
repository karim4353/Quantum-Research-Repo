# Quantum-Research-Repo
A reproducible research repository for exploring **Quantum-Inspired Algorithms & LLVM Optimization Pipeline**. This scaffold provides a lightweight setup for prototyping quantum-inspired algorithms, benchmarking, and experimenting with LLVM-style optimization passes. The repository includes Python-based simulations, C++ compiler stubs, and comprehensive documentation for ease of use and extensibility.

## Quick Start (5–10 min Demo — No Heavy Dependencies Required)

Get started with a quick demo that runs in simulation mode (using NumPy) without requiring heavy dependencies like PyTorch or tensornetwork.

1. **Extract the Repository**:
   ```bash
   unzip Quantum-Research-Repo.zip
   cd Quantum-Research-Repo
   ```

2. **(Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   Create a Python virtual environment and install lightweight dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r python/requirements.txt
   pip install pytest flake8 psutil
   ```
   > **Note**: PyTorch and tensornetwork are optional. The `--sim` flag ensures the demo runs with NumPy as a fallback.

3. **Run the Quick Demo**:
   Generate an example IR and run the benchmark in simulation mode:
   ```bash
   python python/src/cli.py         # Writes an example IR to examples/
   python python/src/bench/run_bench.py --sim
   ```

4. **View Results**:
   After running the demo, check the following outputs:
   - `results/logs/bench.csv`: Benchmark results in CSV format.
   - `results/plots/bench.png`: Visualization of benchmark data.
   - `results/plots/demo.gif`: A small animation showcasing the demo.
   - `results/report.html`: A detailed HTML report of the results.

5. **(Optional) Build the C++ Stub**:
   Build and run the C++ compiler pass stub (works even without LLVM dev libraries):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p compiler/build && cd compiler/build
   cmake .. && make
   ./apply_pass --sim example_ir
   ```
   > **Note**: The `--sim` flag ensures deterministic output without requiring LLVM dependencies.

6. **Run Tests**:
   Verify the setup with Python and C++ tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/python_tests
   ./tests/cpp_tests/test_stub.sh
   ```

## Repository Structure

- **`docs/`**: Detailed documentation, including `design.md` with architecture diagrams and a short paper summary.
- **`python/`**: Python scripts, including benchmarking tools (`src/bench/run_bench.py`) and CLI utilities (`src/cli.py`).
- **`compiler/`**: C++ code for a toy LLVM-style optimization pass, including a CMake project and a stub for algebraic simplification.
- **`examples/`**: Example IR files generated by the CLI or used in demos.
- **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for automation and setup.
- **`tests/`**: Python and C++ test suites (`python_tests/` and `cpp_tests/`).
- **`results/`**: Output directory for logs, plots, and reports.
- **`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`**: CI configuration for GitHub Actions, supporting both lightweight (sim-mode) and full (PyTorch + tensornetwork) setups.

## Implementation Highlights

- **Lightweight Demo**: The Python benchmarking scripts and Jupyter notebooks include a `--sim` mode that uses NumPy as a fallback, ensuring the demo runs without PyTorch or tensornetwork.
- **C++ Compiler Pass**: The `compiler/` directory contains a CMake-based project with a stub for an algebraic simplifier that rewrites a toy IR. It builds and runs in `--sim` mode even without LLVM development libraries.
- **CI Pipeline**: The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`) tests both lightweight (NumPy-based) and full (PyTorch + tensornetwork) configurations, ensuring compatibility and reliability.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Expanded notebooks in `python/notebooks/` include detailed walkthrough cells with rendered outputs for easier experimentation and visualization.
- **Demo Animation**: A small animation (`results/plots/demo.gif`) visualizes the quantum-inspired algorithm in action.

## Advanced Setup (Full Dependencies)

For users interested in the full setup with PyTorch and tensornetwork:

1. Install additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r python/requirements_full.txt
   ```
   > The `requirements_full.txt` file includes PyTorch, tensornetwork, and other optional dependencies for advanced quantum-inspired simulations.

2. Run the benchmark with full dependencies:
   ```bash
   python python/src/bench/run_bench.py
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in `python/notebooks/` for detailed walkthroughs and visualizations.

## Development Roadmap

- **Enhanced Notebooks**: Further expand Jupyter notebooks with interactive examples, additional visualizations, and detailed explanations of quantum-inspired algorithms.
- **Full C++ Pass**: Develop the C++ pass in `compiler/` into a fully functional algebraic simplifier that optimizes toy IRs with quantum-inspired techniques.
- **CI Matrix**: Update the CI pipeline to test multiple Python versions and both lightweight and full dependency configurations.
